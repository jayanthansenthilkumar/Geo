## 🔄 HOW IT WORKS

### Smart Role Detection:
```javascript
1. User logs in via login.html (Admin/Gov/Supervisor)
   OR public-login.html (Public users)

2. Session stored with role information
   - Admin: sessionStorage.currentUser.role = "admin"
   - Government: sessionStorage.currentUser.role = "government"
   - Public: sessionStorage.publicUser (special storage)

3. dashboard.html detects role on load:
   function initDashboard() {
       const adminUser = sessionStorage.getItem('currentUser');
       const publicUser = sessionStorage.getItem('publicUser');
       
       if (adminUser) {
           currentRole = JSON.parse(adminUser).role;
       } else if (publicUser) {
           currentRole = 'public';
       }
       
       loadDashboardForRole(currentRole);
   }

4. Appropriate dashboard loaded:
   - loadAdminDashboard()
   - loadGovernmentDashboard()
   - loadPublicDashboard()
   - loadSupervisorDashboard()
```

## 💾 DATABASE READY

### Current: LocalStorage (Works Now!)
```javascript
// Current implementation
const DB = new DatabaseManager(); // Uses localStorage
const issues = DB.getAllIssues();
```

### Future: Java Spring Boot (When Ready)
```java
// Backend ready to implement
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/issues")
public class IssueController {
    @GetMapping
    public List<Issue> getAllIssues() {
        return issueService.findAll();
    }
}
```

### Frontend Migration Path:
```javascript
// Phase 1: Current (LocalStorage)
const issues = DB.getAllIssues();

// Phase 2: API (Future)
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/api/issues');
const issues = await response.json();
```

## 🛠️ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Role Detection Code:
```javascript
function initDashboard() {
    // Check both session types
    const adminUser = sessionStorage.getItem('currentUser');
    const publicUserData = sessionStorage.getItem('publicUser');

    if (adminUser) {
        currentUser = JSON.parse(adminUser);
        currentRole = currentUser.role; // admin, supervisor, government
    } else if (publicUserData) {
        currentUser = JSON.parse(publicUserData);
        currentRole = 'public';
    } else {
        // Not logged in - redirect
        window.location.href = 'welcome.html';
        return;
    }

    // Load appropriate dashboard
    loadDashboardForRole(currentRole);
}
```

### Dynamic Content Loading:
```javascript
function loadDashboardForRole(role) {
    // Update user info
    document.getElementById('user-info').textContent = 
        `👤 ${currentUser.name} (${role.toUpperCase()})`;

    // Load role-specific view
    switch(role) {
        case 'admin':
            loadAdminDashboard();
            break;
        case 'supervisor':
            loadSupervisorDashboard();
            break;
        case 'government':
            loadGovernmentDashboard();
            break;
        case 'public':
            loadPublicDashboard();
            break;
    }
